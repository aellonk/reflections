1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I am working on a project from another computer or if
it is someone else's project. Remote repositories allow you to work on a project alongside
other contributors. 

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually gives you more control over the changes that will occur in the 
remote repository. If multiple people are working on the files remotely, you wouldn't want
all of their changes automatically updated because it would cause confusion and alter others' work. 

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are local versions of a file. A clone is a copy of a file or batch of files from github to your 
local computer. A fork is like a clone except it copies the file(s) from a github user to your github, allowing
the original to be credited and also shows that user any changes you make, which allows for collaborative
improvements.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to work offline on the files.
