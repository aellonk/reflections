When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I am working on a project from another computer or if
it is someone else's project. Remote repositories allow you to work on a project alongside
other contributors. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually gives you more control over the changes that will occur in the 
remote repository. If multiple people are working on the files remotely, you wouldn't want
all of their changes automatically updated because it would cause confusion and alter others' work.
