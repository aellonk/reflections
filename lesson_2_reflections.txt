What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	After navigating to the correct directory in the terminal, you need to 
	run the command "git init" in order to create a new repository. Then you 
	can check if it worked by running the command "ls -a" to get a list of the 
	contents in the repository. This should include .git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area offers a space to gather files you are done with but want 
	to  wait to commit. Perhaps you want to commit a certain file along with another 
	file you are still working on. The certain file can wait in the staging area until 
	you are ready to commit both files together. The staging area allows you to put it 
	aside from your working directory but also prevents it from being in the repository 
	before it's ready.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
